# HTML Unicode Explorer 
---
This is a Javascript page that shows 100 unicode characters at a time as currently supported by the active font. 

I built this because I was tired of looking up the HTML codes for Unicode characters to use for concise web pages. 

This also allows a user too bookmark their values.

### ToDo :


- Add mnemonic codes like &amp;copy; for &copy;
- Add dark mode
- Allow sharing of bookmarks
- Allow active font to be changes.
- Allow copying of codes into an input text field
